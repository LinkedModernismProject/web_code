    Hi Stephen,<br class="">
    <br class="">
    Happy Wednesday. Please find attached a spreadsheet consisting of a
    confidence rating, the entity names from your ontology, the closest
    Wikipedia entry to that entity, and the "un-comma-ed" string that we
    used to search Wikipedia.<br class="">
    <br class="">
    I did the alignment into Wikipedia and Colin did the confidence
    ratings today. We think that things in the 8-9 confidence range are
    highly reliable, but the things with a 7 or lower need manual
    review. Things at this level may match just a last name or a first
    name, but not both. That leaves you with 1784 good alignments, and
    about 659 to go through and review. Things with a 3 or lower are
    basically a lost cause.<br class="">
    <br class="">
    We'd recommend having a someone go through and add another column
    and just mark Y if it is a match and N if it isn't for a hand
    spot-check. After that, you could either look for good matches for
    the unmatched ones, or just move on with what you've got.<br class="">
    <br class="">
    There's two files, a raw "tsv" (tab-separated values) file in
    Unicode (UTF-8), which is great for a programmer to mess with. I
    went ahead and made a native Excel version just to keep all the
    accent marks for manual review if using a spreadsheet program.
    Either way can be transformed back to something programmable.<br class="">
    <br class="">
    If you'd like to chat about next steps with the datasets, I'll be
    free on Thursday (tomorrow) 4-7pm eastern, 1-4pm pacific.<br class="">
    <br class="">
    Best,<br class="">
