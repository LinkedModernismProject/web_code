#Documentation

#Aliases
In your own terminal, to log onto our server, I've aliased it as: site
Change to vsp where all our main stuff is: vsp
Change to weeklyRun/newData/newTXT: addtxt
Change to weeklyRun/deleteData/deleteTXT: deltxt
Change to weeklyRun/newData/converters: converters
Change to weeklyRun/newData/newDOCX: newdocx
Change to use ISQL: vob
Create a file: stf
Change owner of file: scc
Run turtle_form.py converter: getformdata
Run turtle_singles.py converter: getsingledata

#VIM Commands
  Once in you can hit 'i' to go into INSERT mode, then start editing
  To quit use ESC :q
  To force quit use ESC :q!
  To write(save) and quit ESC :wq


#Creating and Changing owners of files(so you can save them)
  To create the file: stf filename
  To change owner of file so you can save it: scc filename

#Flattening a folder
  cd ~/temp
  getfilelist path_to_directory_that_want_flattened
  Then it puts them all into newDOCX (use alias newdocx to go into newDOCX)

#To upload data to Quad Store with Turtle Files
  Go to http://linkedmods.uvic.ca:8890/conductor/
  Go to Linked Data tab
  Go to Quad Store Upload
  Choose edited file to upload
  Change Named Graph IRI to either bestDataProduction(for searches) or bestDataRelFinder(for RelFinder)

#Looking up specific data on Conductor:
  http://linkedmods.uvic.ca:8890/conductor/
  Username: dba
  Password: in email
  Go to Linked Data tab -> Graphs tab
  Find bestDataProduction(for searches) or bestDataRelFinder(for RelFinder)
  Go to SPARQL tab
  Enter Graph IRI
  Query: select * where {?s ?p ?o} limit 100
    Ex to search bestDataProduction:
      To specify some subject: select * where {<http://modernism.uvic.ca/metadata#Stephen_Ross> ?p ?o} limit 100
    Ex to RelFinder bestDataRelFinder:
      To specify some subject: select * where {<http://modernism.uvic.ca/metadata/Stephen_Ross> ?p ?o} limit 100

#Using ISQL & Creating Backups
  Change directory to /usr/local/virtuoso-opensource/bin  (aliased to vob)
  ./isql 1111 vspdemo
  Enter Password: Igneel
  #Copy a graph IRI into another graph IRI, will create destination graph if non-existent
    #Ones I used, I suggest you use the backups as well so we don't have a ton of other graph IRIs floating around
    sparql COPY <http://localhost:8890/bestDataProduction> TO <http://localhost:8890/bestDataProduction_backup>;
    sparql COPY <http://localhost:8890/bestDataRelFinder> TO <http://localhost:8890/bestDataRelFinder_backup>;

#Removing Single Triples
logon to server (alias: site)




#Get a new training set (ask Brayden for further instructions)
->make new training set


#Inputting data
  Contribute->Enter Information
  ->Fill out a form with data or a single triple
  ->Or can just make a .txt file within the addtxt directory that has the format of subjTABTABobjTABTABpredNEWLINE

#To get data from single triples and form data
->Then run the turtle_singles and turtle_form converters
  getformdata to get the form data into input.txt in newTXT
  getsingledata to get the single triples added data into input.txt in newTXT
  You can go into newTXT(use alias addtxt), and you can view the input.txt file with vim

->Get data from stanfordCore (ask Brayden for further instructions)


->Then once in subjTABTABobjTABTABpredNEWLINE format
  make
  #Running make will ask for a password(Igneel), need two (1 for batch_add, 1 for batch_add_RelFinder)

->Then we can run batch adds for data to be added to bestDataProduction & bestDataRelFinder

#Deleting data
  deltxt to get to directory, then whatever is in the .txt files will be deleted, so check them first.
  The .txt files must be in the subjTABTABobjTABTABpredNEWLINE format
  Then once confirmed what is wanted deleted
  Run make
  Enter passwords, same as above


#SCP Send Cool Package
Sending a directory:
  Format: scp -ri ~/.ssh/key.pem filename centos@IP:/path/to/destination
  Ex: scp -ri ~/.ssh/compute_canada_key.pem Ready/ centos@206.12.59.136:~/temp
Sending a single file:
  Format: scp -Ci ~/.ssh/compute_canada_key.pem filename centos@IP:/path/to/destination
  Ex: scp -Ci ~/.ssh/compute_canada_key.pem test.txt centos@206.12.59.136:~/temp
